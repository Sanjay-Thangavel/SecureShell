 AWS AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to make it easy for applications to get exactly the data they need on AWS. One of the great things about writing clients for AppSync is that GraphQL queries and mutations can be sent as HTTP POST messages. This means just about any programming language or client framework can talk to an AppSync API. AppSync also gives you the ability to provide real-time events via GraphQL subscriptions. For example, if a client wants to be notified when a certain data record changes, it can subscribe to that change and get a notification containing the relevant data. Since the GraphQL spec doesnâ€™t dictate how subscriptions work, every GraphQL implementation may have a different way to handle this important feature.

In November, the AppSync product team improved and simplified the AppSync subscriptions protocol by using pure WebSockets. The new protocol supports a higher maximum payload size (240kb vs. 128kb), enhanced connection and broadcast rates, CloudWatch metrics, and selection set filtering for GraphQL subscriptions. Real-time data, connections, scalability, fan-out and broadcasting are all handled by AppSync.
